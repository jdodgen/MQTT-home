I'll clean this md up later    
A reverse tunnel between client and server. Client on a LAN without a static IP address granting access to a port to a server.    
the default port is 9004 which is the same port at both ends      
http://<your vps>:9004/your data       
on the client rinning this you have a http server monitoring 9004    
and doing somthing with the request.   
First use was to serve a jpeg from a local IP camera to a web page served by a vps server.
