home-broker - a small dedicated mqtt, fauxmo and zigbee server
it consolodates zigbee and Internet/WiFi devices in a sqlite database.

a small http server exists: 
    1) maintain/map fauxmo devices
    2) provides a link zigbee2mqtt to maintain zigbee devices
    3) allow manual entry of custom IP devices
    4) collects nome-broker pub/sub devices 
    5) view consilodated devices and generated topics/payloads
    6) it can be used to test devices turn on and off
	7) ssh tunnel and server for camera jpg access
	8) MQTT email gateway
	9) timers sending on and off topics
	10) ...

It serves device information via pub/sub to extract devices from database
to be used by another automation system. This data is simplfied and 
formatted data including the pub/sub strings 

Hardware. 
SBC  pretty much anthing that can run Linux with Eathernet RJ45 
    and a USB port for the zigbee dongle if using zigbee2mqtt
 
here are the working dongles

# Test system: 
"Le Potato" (because RPI 3's were unavailble).
"SONOFF Zigbee 3.0 USB Dongle" (compatable and cheap)

# from:

# think about downloading  
mqttplugin.py 
# and place it here with the rest of the py code

# it might already be included
# install raspbian lite or linux distro of your choice

# we name this "home-broker" later
# you can access via http://home-broker.local  when on your LAN

# set login 

# if using raspian change the following in raspi-config:

sudo raspi-config

    # fix the following:
    # system option > host name "home-broker"
	# system > auto login (this system auto runs at boot
    #        to make debugging easier)
	# interface options > enable ssh
	# performance options > video memory as small as possable
	# localization set time zone
    # advanced options expand sd card 
	# when finished allow it to reboot

# now "putty in" from your computer to make things easier:

use home-broker.local for the address

code replace /dev/ttyUSB0 with your ZBC port
edit  .bashrc 
add to the end

```

# Notes
# If replicating/copying prebuilt immages make sure 
# the /opt/zigbee2mqtt/data stuff is fresh and not 
# a previous install
# configuration.yaml should be fresh
# coordinator_backup.json should be deleted
# Unsure about database.db
