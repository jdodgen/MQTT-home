home-broker 

# download mqttplugin.py if you want a newer version
https://github.com/n8henrie/fauxmo-plugins
and replace the current one in the  home-broker py code

install raspbian lite or the linux distro of your choice
use the lite or server versions. 

do "ip a" to get ip address

the rest is eaiser with putty

raspbian fixed with rpi imaging tool

# So you can access via http://home-broker.local  when on your LAN

# if using raspian change the following as needed, in raspi-config:

sudo raspi-config

  # fix the following:
  # system option > host name "home-broker"
  # system > auto login (this system auto runs at boot
  #        to make debugging easier)
  # interface options > enable ssh  
  # not working --  performance options > video memory as small as possable
  # localization set time zone
  # advanced options expand sd card 
  # when finished allow it to reboot

# now "putty in" from your desktop to make things easier:
use home-broker.local for the address (Or what ever you changed it to).

# we install the following:
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install pip
sudo apt install mosquitto
sudo apt install sqlite3

# also some python parts are needed:
sudo pip install fauxmo    --break-system-packages
sudo pip install paho.mqtt --break-system-packages
sudo pip install gevent    --break-system-packages
sudo pip install flask     --break-system-packages
sudo pip install pgrep     --break-system-packages

# now install zigbee2mqtt from here

https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/installation/01_linux.html

sudo curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs git make g++ gcc libsystemd-dev make

sudo mkdir /opt/zigbee2mqtt
sudo chown -R ${USER}: /opt/zigbee2mqtt

git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt.git /opt/zigbee2mqtt

cd /opt/zigbee2mqtt
npm ci

npm run build

cp /opt/zigbee2mqtt/data/configuration.example.yaml /opt/zigbee2mqtt/data/configuration.yaml

# notes:

# broker has not been configured yet 
# note: cd /opt/zigbee2mqtt
# note: npm start

# now install home-broker code
# bulk load of our code see "install_files.bat"
sshpass -p foobar sftp -oBatchMode=no -b install_files.bat jim@192.168.0.193

# at this point you need to know what tty the zigbee dongle is on
# typicaly it is ttyUSB0 your SBC/linux may be different

# edit  .bashrc we are running from here
# add to the end the following:

setterm -blank 0
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0  
echo booting in 10 seconds
sleep 10
sudo python3 main.py

# Now confugured so reboot.  
# System is alive now http://home-broker.local to localy configure

'''
this is desihgned to be a standalone system
once built and SD image saved
replacated as needed, zero pre boot customation.
simply accessed as http://home-broker.local on the end users LAN.
For now no login,  because this is running on a small LAN
protection is provided by the router/firewall.
