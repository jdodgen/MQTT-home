this is on ubuntu 16.10+   current 22.04 LTS

make host name "alertaway'
user alertaway password "foobar"

ignore this   ---------- network enp1so and enp3so looks like the pcie card became enp1so
install with as little as possable, just required utilities  -- DO NOT select LAMP server too much baggage

use entire disk --- typicaly ext4

only install:
OpenSSH Server
basic utilities  -- seems to be missing 22.04 LTS


no automatic updates, install grub on hard drive if asked

soon to reboot

login and get the ip address with ip -c a
apt install iputils-ping


if needed as root on console
adduser alertaway
usermod -aG sudo alertaway

login as alertaway foobar
sudo su

passwd root     --- foobar
passwd -u root

logout and back in as root or sudo su
setterm -blank 0   -- only needed from console

reboot

===================================
now The AlertAway install starts
note: all the instalation goes into /root

easiest to do with a remote terminal like Putty

if going remote login as alertaway and

sudo su   --- to become root

do a "cd" to position you at /root

now pull in the things needed or push to alertaway

Notes:

to replace an existing xbee/PAN use this

perl -I . HomeMonitor.pl <panid 64> <panid 16> <op channel> <stack>

example perl -I . HomeMonitor.pl 34ef 29BE 14 1

all values are hex
This reprograms the xbee to be on the chosen network
