# MQTT-home
A collection of my MQTT based home automation devices
I chose to use seperate directories for each project 
to make the reuse of the routines found in librarys
Which allows my install files the ability to do "../../library/foo.py" syntax
submodules seem a little problmatic for me. I might change later.
# library
Common python routines shared amoung linux and micropython devices
# linux
Linux IoT, typicaly RPI ore equiv devices
# micropython
mostly ESP32-S2 projects and cantains a libray specific to micropython devices
